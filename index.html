<h1>Reach Out!</h1>
<div>Today, more people than ever are isolated and cut off from this love because of COVID-19, age, mental health, and social/family challenges. By reaching out to them with a letter, note, or card we can share the light of our hope and love with them.</div>
<div>
<h3>1) Pick a recipient</h3>
<div>A partner, a friend, or anyone in your life that needs a little love.</div>
<div><a href='https://braidmission.org/get-involved/cards-of-hope/'>Any kid in a group home foster care, or institution via the Braid Mission</a></div>
<div><a href='https://loveforourelders.org/letters'>Any isolated senior (e.g. in long term care) via the Love to Our Elders Project</a></div>
<div><a href='https://www.moreloveletters.com/the-letter-requests'>Any particular person going through a difficult time via the More Love Letters Project.</a></div>

</div>
<div>
<h3>2) Write and Decorate</h3>
<div> Write your message in a card or letter. Don't worry about making it perfect, just focus on being authentic. Think about the kind of things you'd like to hear in their situation. The mere act of sending creates joy in those who recieve it.</div>
<div>Decorate your letter with whatever art supplies you have on hand. Colored pencils, markers, stickers, etc are all possiblities. Even if you just have a regular pen and paper, you can still embellish your letter by drawing things like little hearts, swirls, scrolls, or paw prints. Let your imagination and personal style be your guide!</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>3) Include extras.</h3>
<div>Some people like to add extra goodies along with their letter. Popular items include pieces of origami, bookmarks, sheets of stickers, and even tea bags. Anything goes, just as long as it's flat, flexible, liteweight, and 'safe for work.'</div>
<div>
<h3>4) Put everything in a regular envelope, address it, and mail it!</h3>
<div>You can leave your return address off if you prefer (Just make the return address the same as the delivery address). Some people add a little decoration to this envelope too.</div>
